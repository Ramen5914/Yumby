#### Serrated Knife
- Also known as a bread knife, the serrated blade makes it ideal for cutting through soft or delicate items with a hard crust or skin, like bread, tomatoes, and cakes, without crushing them.
#### Utility Knife
- Mid-sized (about 5 to 7 inches) and versatile, often used for slicing small to medium produce and other items that don't require a chef's knife.
#### Boning Knife
- Has a narrow, pointed blade (usually 5 to 6 inches) that’s slightly flexible, ideal for breaking down cuts of meat and poultry and removing bones cleanly.

#### Fillet Knife
