## Cookware
### Pot
- made of iron
- fill with fluids, usually broth
- Boiling, simmering, stewing
- place above a heating element (campfire, stove, lava?)
- make sure to stir and keep track of temp

### Pan
- shakey shakey (:
- used for saute and drier dishes, like omelettes
- Frying, sauteing, and baking (when put in an oven)

### Skillet
- frying, saut√©ing, and searing
*potentially redundant, considering pan*
### Saucepan
- Smaller pots with long handles

### Muffin Tins
- Assorted Baking pans that have can shape the dough

## Other
### Rotisserie Spit
- For use on campfires or over lava
- Mostly with meats
- manually spin it. when over lava cooks faster but needs constant attention

### Mortar and Pestle
- Grinding spices

### Refrigerator
- Store perishable foods

### Freezer
- Freeze items for long term storage
**I think freezer and refrigerator coukd be merged into a simple ice chest that slows spiikage based on the amount of ice in it.**
## Utensils

**I think most of these are unnecessary, though im not sure what to replace their functions with. potentially a simple "kitchen workstation" where you can prep ingredients, stir them, stuff like that. we can probably have stirring and flipping intrinsic to the pots and stuff**
