## Knives
    Not sure how many of these I'll actually add, but I just looked up some of the most common knives used in professional kitchens.
- Chef's Knife
  - The workhorse of the kitchen, usually 8 to 10 inches long, used for chopping, slicing, dicing, and mincing almost anything, from vegetables to meat.
- Paring Knife
  - Small and versatile (3 to 4 inches), this knife is used for more delicate work like peeling, trimming, and precise cuts on small fruits and vegetables.
- Serrated Knife
  - Also known as a bread knife, the serrated blade makes it ideal for cutting through soft or delicate items with a hard crust or skin, like bread, tomatoes, and cakes, without crushing them.
- Utility Knife
  - Mid-sized (about 5 to 7 inches) and versatile, often used for slicing small to medium produce and other items that don't require a chef's knife.
- Boning Knife
  - Has a narrow, pointed blade (usually 5 to 6 inches) that’s slightly flexible, ideal for breaking down cuts of meat and poultry and removing bones cleanly.
- Santoku Knife
  - A Japanese-style knife similar to a chef’s knife but usually shorter, with a flat edge and a rounded tip. It's excellent for slicing, dicing, and chopping, particularly for thin, precise cuts.
- Cleaver
  - A large, heavy knife with a rectangular blade used for breaking down large cuts of meat, including cutting through bone.
- Fillet Knife
  - Similar to a boning knife but thinner and more flexible, specifically designed for filleting fish and creating precise cuts close to the bone.
- Carving Knife
  - Long and thin with a sharp tip, designed for slicing cooked meat into clean, thin slices, often used with roasts or large cuts of meat.
- Nakiri Knife
  - A Japanese vegetable knife with a rectangular blade designed specifically for chopping vegetables, as its flat blade makes it easy to slice all the way through to the cutting board.
- Peeling/Tourne Knife
  - A small knife with a curved blade, perfect for peeling round fruits and vegetables or making intricate cuts for garnishes.
